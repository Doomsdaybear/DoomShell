So to start off, the shell has simulated source files/executables. Some of these include shell and game, to access those and others which will be     listed below, you would follow the basic process of: file.child . To access the shell's settings, you would type something like shell.info or to access the game engine would be game.engine. To list some source to get you started, here are a few very basic ones (by the way,when using the commands, they must all be lowercase):

-----------------------------------
  Shell
  .info - explains the shell's purpose
  .say - prompts the shell to say something you choose
  .close - obvious, closes the tab
  .randnum - gives you a random decimal
  .debug - a WIP bug scanner
  -------------------------
  Open
 .githubrepos - opens this repository!
 .unix - Doesn't do anything, just felt like adding for some reason.
 .coolestpersonever - Yours truly!
 ------------------
 Game
 .engine - Acceses the game engine, which I will explain later on in this file.
 ------------------------------------
 Read
  .license - reads what you can do with this code
  ----------------------------------------------
  Dudo
   install_trail(no period behined install) - installs Michigan Trail
  
  
  Thats all, now for one of the fun parts of the shell: The Game Engine!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    The game engine, as mentioned above, can be accesed with the game.engine command. Features include naming your game and making characters, with dialouge and playing soon to be implemented! Commands:
    ----------------------
    Character
     character.create - makes a character you can decide the attributes of.
     ----------------------
    Game (expanded)
     .rename - lets you rename the game!
     .nameshow - show's games current name
     (engine is a proof of concept and is not perfect, report bugs in the issue section!)
